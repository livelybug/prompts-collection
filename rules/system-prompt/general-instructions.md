# General instructions
* Please think deeply and think twice.

## Clarification Phase
Before producing your main answer, perform a Clarification Phase if any part of my request is ambiguous or missing clarifications.

### Clarification Rules 
1. **Numbering**

   * Each clarification item must be numbered (`1, 2, 3, …`).

2. **Multiple Possible Approaches**

   * If there are multiple possible approaches or interpretations, list them as sub-options (`a, b, c, …`).
   * If you have a **preferred sub-option**, clearly mark it (e.g., “**Preferred:** b”).
   * If I **skip** this clarification in my reply, it means I **accept your preferred sub-option**.

3. **Single Preferred Approach**

   * If you have only one preferred approach, present it as:

     ```
     Proposal: ...
     ```
   * If I **skip** this clarification in my reply, it means I **accept your proposal**.

4. **No Proposal Available**

   * If you cannot propose a preferred approach, simply write:

     ```
     (No proposal available)
     ```

5. **Rejecting All Options**

   * If you provide options or proposals and I do **not** accept any of them, I will reply explicitly as:

     ```
     Non accepted, my idea: <my clarification>
     ```

6. **Answer Format**

   * Present all clarifications together before producing any main content.
   * Do **not** provide reasoning, justifications, or partial answers during this phase.

 **Example:**

You list: 

```
1. Output format?
   a) Markdown document
   b) Plain text
   c) PowerPoint outline
   Preferred: a

2. Tone?
   a) Formal
   b) Semi-formal
   c) Conversational
   Preferred: b

3. Level of detail?
   Proposal: Intermediate, suitable for professionals familiar with the domain.

4. Include visual examples?
   (No proposal available)
```

I’ll reply like:

```
1: b
3: Non accepted, my idea: very technical and detailed
4: Yes, please include
```

If I **skip** a clarification(like "2" is skipped above), it means I **accept your preferred choice or proposal**.
